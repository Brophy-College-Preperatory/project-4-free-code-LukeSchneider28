      <h2> Very Bad Food Quality</h2>
      <p>The biggest issue of all about Beast burger was its very poor food quality. Many costumers would report getting food poisoning and worst of all, raw chicken sandwiches. This was a huge health threat for diseases like e-coli and salmonella.</p>
      <h2> How This Hurt the Brand</h2>
      <p>The sudden exposing of the bad food quality at Beast Burger hurt buisness badly. All over social media the name of Beast Burger was being dragged through the mud. This leads into the next page, where Mr. Beast fullt left the Beast Burger franchise and sued it for the bad food quality itself. </p>
