        <p> When Mr. Beast burger had finally released, there was an overwhelming amount of support from the media and fans. On December 19, 2020, Beast Burger had its grand opening, with hundreds of cars lined up waiting to get food and hopefully meet Mr. Beast. Some locations throughout the United States reported staggering profits on their debuts, including a location in Dallas that reported reeling in over $7,000 on just its first day. Mr. Beast Burger officially made its first $100 million in just seven months of being open. The hype that the Mr. Beast brand put on skyrocketed the value of Beast Burger. In this time, Beast Burger seemed like one of the best investments that an influencer as big as Mr. Beast could make. 
        <h2> How did Beast Burger Get so Popular so Fast?</h2>
        <p>The company had everything it needed behind it: a famous person who avidly advertised and supported the brand, lots of the younger population since most of Mr. Beast's videos on social media was targeted towards children, and finally the media supported Jimmy heavily since he had made many philanthropic donations and has had a large positive effect on the world. All of these factors contributed to the quick success of Beast Burger.</p>
