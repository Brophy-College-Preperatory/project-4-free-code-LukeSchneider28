    <p> Mr. Beast is an online influencer who has received a lot of fame in the last 5-7 years. Along with this fame, Mr. Beast, who's real name is Jimmy Donaldson, is an avid philanthropist who has made many contributions to charities and even built schools, donated shoes to young children, and built wells in many impoverished African countries. In an attempt to further improve his brand, Donaldson decided to take his efforts into the fast food industry, launching his own burger chain, titled "<a href="https://www.mrbeastburger.com/">Beast Burger</a>". This company sold typical burgers, fries, chicken sandwiches, and animal style fries which were branded, "Beast style fries". Every single major menu item was given a special name that was based off of one of the famous Mr. Beast crew members.  </p>
